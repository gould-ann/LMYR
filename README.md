# Long May You Run 

A lot of this was created with [Devin Uner](https://github.com/Devin-Uner/) who I cannot thank enough for creating this with me!

Long May You Run is currently out of use as the API from [IBM](http://opendata.mybluemix.net/) has been depreciated. This API had records of crime data from large cities like Chicago and San Francisco. APIs like this don't really exist, so if anyone finds an API like this that uses coordinates to find crimes around the area please let me or Devin know!
